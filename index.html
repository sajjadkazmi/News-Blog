                <p>The best fish tacos in Toronto encourage diners to grab their food with both hands, ignore their
                    surroundings, and devour each crisp, tangy, chewy bite. Fish tacos are a classic dish that combines
                    warm tortillas, fried fish, slaw, and a creamy, slightly spicy sauce. Food that beckons, regardless
                    of season or time of day.</p>
